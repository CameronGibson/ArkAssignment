DBMS: SQLServer /
Programming Language: Python

Imports used: 
  pyodbc - for SQLServer connection.
  sys - just for exiting gracefully.
  csv - to use the csv file reading library.
  
All of my code is in Main.py, I opted against separating things into different files for the sake of simplicity and the code base isn't too large.

The SQL queries that were written to create my Database and it's Tables are located in the Table Creation Commands folder.

The SQL queries that were used to answer the questions below are located in the Phase Two Commands folder.

Enjoy! I had a good time playing with Python more in depth for the first time, it's starting to grow on me :)
